      <p>
        In my many years of experience with mathematics, teaching, and
        programming, I have mastered the arts of problem-solving, analytical
        thinking, clear and concise communication, and attention to detail.
        During my time working in prison, I have developed a heart for finding
        innovative ways to serve the underserved. I am eagerly seeking
        opportunities to use these skills and passions to serve others by
        creating effective, efficient, and creative code solutions.{" "}
