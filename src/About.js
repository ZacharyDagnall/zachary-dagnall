      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
        In my many years of experience with mathematics, teaching, and
        programming, I have mastered the arts of{" "}
        <strong>problem-solving</strong>, <strong>analytical thinking</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>clear and concise communication</strong>, and{" "}
        <strong>attention to detail</strong>. During my time working with
        incarcerated individuals, I have developed a{" "}
        <span className="heart">heart</span> for finding innovative ways to{" "}
        <strong>serve the underserved</strong>. I am eagerly seeking
        opportunities to use these skills and passions to serve others by
        creating effective, efficient, and creative code solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of programming and teaching, I am <em>always</em> learning new
        things. From studying new languages (currently pursuing Spanish, as well
        as Hindi and Chinese), to studying the Bible, from teaching myself new
        skills (most recently- rollerblading!), to learning more about the
        people and world around me, I have never stopped and will never stop
        learning and pursuing deeper understandings of life, the world, and all
        those who live in it.
